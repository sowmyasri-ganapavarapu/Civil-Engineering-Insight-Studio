# Civil-Engineering-Insight-Studio
Civil Engineering Insight Studio is a data-driven analysis and visualization platform designed to explore infrastructure trends, construction insights and engineering performance metrics. It features a Streamlit application powered by Google’s Gemini AI to analyze civil engineering structures from images and generate intelligent structural insights for informed decision-making.
